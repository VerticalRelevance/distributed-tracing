I can see the issue in your code. The error occurs because `st.experimental_rerun()` has been deprecated in newer versions of Streamlit and was replaced with just `st.rerun()`.

Here's how to fix your code:

```python
# Replace all instances of st.experimental_rerun() with st.rerun()
```

Specifically, you need to make the following changes:

1. In the `display_json_node` function:
   ```python
   if col1.button("➖", key=f"btn_{current_path}"):
       expanded_paths[current_path] = False
       st.rerun()  # Changed from st.experimental_rerun()
   ```
   and
   ```python
   if col1.button("➕", key=f"btn_{current_path}"):
       expanded_paths[current_path] = True
       st.rerun()  # Changed from st.experimental_rerun()
   ```

2. In the `main` function:
   ```python
   if st.sidebar.button("Expand all nodes"):
       st.session_state.expand_all = True
       st.rerun()  # Changed from st.experimental_rerun()
   ```
   and
   ```python
   if st.sidebar.button("Collapse all nodes"):
       st.session_state.expanded_paths = {}
       st.rerun()  # Changed from st.experimental_rerun()
   ```

This change will make your code compatible with the current version of Streamlit. The `experimental_rerun()` function was renamed to just `rerun()` when it moved out of experimental status.
